# New-York-City-Yellow-Cab-Fare-Prediction-with-Classic-Machine-Learning

In this project we predict taxi fares in New York City using classic machine learning algorithms. For the training we use the data downloaded from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction">here</a>.

The implementation was performed using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
